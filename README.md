# Design Your Own Grid-based Framework

## [Collaborative Project]

This assignment consists of building a grid-based framework (similar to bootstrap) that includes some basic functionality necessary to build a website.

You can find the original project specification [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/design-your-own-grid-based-framework).

## Additional Microverse Adjustments

### General

- It includes a descriptive README file.
- Inline comments only when considered necessary.
- Files not related to the project are added to `.gitignore`.
- Code is kept [clean](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp).
- [Semantic HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) is used
- HTML markup is validated with <https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_upload>.
- [Common mistakes](https://speckyboy.com/good-bad-css-practices/) are avoided in the CSS styles.

### Project specific

- Is was created with responsiveness in mind.
- There are 3 breakpoints:
  - breakpoint for small screens with a width of up to 720px.
  - breakpoint for medium screens with a width in the range of 720px - 1024px.
  - breakpoint for large screens with width above 1024px
